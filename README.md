OLLPLLTrainer
=============

This is just a practice project. If you find yourself here reading this readme, you are unlikely to find anything of value. 

I am creating an app that takes pictures of a partially solved Rubik's cube (First two layers done), and then determines
which OLL (orient the last layer) or PLL (permutate the last layer) they need to perform. 

Should you feel so inclined to look at it, I am a new developer and would welcome any feedback! Thanks
